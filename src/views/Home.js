            Dear Teacher,

            During the upcoming five days, we would like to hear more about your experience with
            Evidence-Informed Practices (EIP) and Evidence-Based Practices (EBP).

            Below, you see five cards - one for each day. When you click on a day, you can choose
            between three different task options. Most tasks are designed to take approx. five
            minutes, but some might require a little more time.
          </Typography>
          <Typography gutterBottom style={styles.paragraph1}>
            We would like to ask you to at least complete one task a day but you are free to do more
            if you are interested. Please note that this is not a survey but rather a conversation
            starter and an open space for you to share your experiences/concerns/stories. Grab your
            favourite drink, put on some music, and tell us your story. As a team, we want to
            understand and empathise with you to be able to build a solution that fulfils their
            needs.
          </Typography>

          <Typography gutterBottom style={styles.paragraph2}>
            We hope you enjoy the upcoming days. Thank you for your participation and feel free to
            contact us for any additional information.
