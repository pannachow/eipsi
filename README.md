# EIPSI

This project aims to contribute to the improvement of Primary and Secondary School pupilsâ€™ academic outcomes and reducing the gap between advantaged and disadvantaged pupils through the promotion of Evidence Informed Practice for School Inclusion approach (EIPSI). The challenge is to design a prototype (open digital platform/a community) with the evidence-informed resources for teachers.
